# nuxt-static-landing-page-template (nuxt, typescript, tailwind)

## General

Setting up small static websites to display a company, a product or a portfolio often takes much more time than initially expected. This repository is intended to simplify the start for developers who like to use vue / nuxt. Due to the server side rendering functionality of nuxt, the site is also relatively performant and quite good for SEO.
